Enroll Learners to Courses
==========================

There are two ways to enroll learners to courses:

* Self enrollment
* Administrative enrollment

.. _self_enrollment:

Self enrollment
***************

.. 
This action can be performed by 
:ref:`learner <learner>`.

..
Learners can self-enroll to the public courses. Public courses are all those with :ref:`visibility <courses>` set to "Public" which means all learners can see them in the **Catalog** and self-enroll to them.

..
To self-enroll to the course a learner must perform the following steps:

#. Go to **Catalog** > **Courses**. Specific courses can be found using search and filtering options on the **Catalog** page.
#. Click the tile of the course you wish to self-enroll to.
#. You will be redirected to the course page. 
#. In the right sidebar there is some general information about the course (rating, status) and action button **Enroll**. All public courses have this action button. Courses which have their visibility set to *read-only* can be viewed but do not have **Enroll** button and learners cannot self-enroll to them.
#. Click on **Enroll** to self-enroll to the course.
#. You will be asked to confirm your action.
#. Click **Yes**.
