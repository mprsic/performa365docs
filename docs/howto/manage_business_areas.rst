About Business Areas
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This feature allows organizing courses from the catalog into a hierarchy of client-managed business areas. They will be used by your learners to filter the catalog according to the area of their current work or the area of interest. This will be especially useful as the number of courses in the catalog grows. Business areas are best used if their represent specific businesses of your organization, i.e. how does the organization create value. It is not the best practice to organize business areas by organization hierarchy, as it tends to change more frequently than the businesses that your organization is involved in, either internally or externally.

Business areas can be organized hierarchicaly, up to 3 levels. 

.. note:: You must have at least one business area in your tenant.
