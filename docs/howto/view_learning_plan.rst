*My courses* layout
*************************

The page displays a collection of courses that user is enrolled into, including courses that have been completed. In other words, courses shown on this page are either *in progress*, *upcoming* or *completed*. Clicking on each course tile will redirect the user to the corresponding course page.
Search and filtering options are displayed on the left side of the page. Search control will allow you to look for courses by their name. Filtering options allow you to view all courses (displayed by default when the page is first loaded). You can also view only courses which are in progressor have been completed by selecting the appropriate filter. Option "With certificates" will filter the courses to show only those which were completed and you were issued a certificate upon completion. 
The right side of the page shows user's courses represented by tiles. Tiles can be sorted by clicking on the sort control in the upper right corner. Sorting options allow courses to be sorted by name, enrollment date or due date.

**Each course tile contains following information:**

#. Course image is displayed to the left. If a certificate is issued at course completion, that information will be shown in a form of a corner banner.
#. The middle part of the tile contains course **Name** and **Primary delivery model**. The status of each course is represented by a progress bar which shows percantage of course completion. **Enrolled on** below the progress bar shows date and time of enrollment. If the course is completed, that information will be shown as **Completed on**.
#. If the user has completed a course and was issued a certificate, on the right side of the tile there will be an image representing that certificate. Clicking on that image will start a download of that course's certificate.
